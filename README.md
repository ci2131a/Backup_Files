# Directory Structure Mimic

A program that mimics the directory structure from a source directory to a target directory. All files and subdirectories that exist in source but not in target will be copied to target. Any files or subdirectories that are in target but not in source will be deleted. 

The program was written in Python with some assistance from JT who showed me to improve the program using recurssive functions. Additional **sc** scripts for running the program in CLI.
